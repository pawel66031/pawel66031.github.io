                Role in the project: Gameplay programmer & level design tool developer
            </p>

            <p>Hexa Mirror is a puzzle game developed for Hello GameJam 2023. It tells the story of a young boy invited
                to a nearby
                circus, only to encounter an evil clown who turns people into briefcases. The player's goal is to
                navigate the hexagonal
                grid, avoid deadly lasers, and ultimately defeat the clown to put an end to his attacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                The core mechanic revolves around movement on a hexagonal board. However, due to time constraints, the
                game lacked a
                proper pathfinding algorithm, which made controlling the character less intuitive. This aspect
                frustrated some players
                and contributed to the game's lower challenge level, as the logic-based puzzles did not reach their full
                potential.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was responsible for all gameplay programming, as well as developing a custom level design tool used by
                the artists to
                streamline the creation of levels (placing lasers, mirrors, and obstacles). One of the biggest
                challenges was time
                pressure and technical difficulties—my old Linux-based machine struggled with low FPS in Unity due to
                driver issues,
                making development harder. In the final stretch, I coordinated with one of the artists to compile and
                finalize the
                project, ensuring we could fix last-minute bugs before the deadline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite its shortcomings, Hexa Mirror placed 9th out of 14 entries in the jam. While the controls and
                challenge level
                received mixed feedback, the game was praised for its visual style. The project was a valuable learning
                experience in
                game development workflows, rapid prototyping, and tool creation for level design.
